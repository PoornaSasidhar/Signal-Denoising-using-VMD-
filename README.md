# Signal Denoising using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) in MATLAB

## 📝 Description
This repository contains MATLAB code for denoising signals using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). VMD is a signal processing technique that decomposes a signal into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residue, allowing for effective denoising.

## 🚀Features
- Reads and processes an audio file for denoising.
- Adds white Gaussian noise to the audio signal.
- Applies Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for signal decomposition.
- Plots the original signal and the decomposed IMFs.
- Calculates and displays Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for input and output signals.

## 📊Results
- Plots of the original signal and the decomposed IMFs are displayed.
- Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) for the input and output signals are calculated and shown.
